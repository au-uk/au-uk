# G'Day and thank's for visiting. 

### This Repository is a collection of things, I don't want to forget and others may want to remember.

I hope you find something useful. 

- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Mark
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Free Open Source Software (FOSS)

### Note: If you find something broken, or insecure. Please fix via a pull request and I'll merge ASAP.

As someone much wiser than me once said:

#### "Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
