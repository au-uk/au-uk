Thank's for visiting. This Repo is a collection of notes, tip and scripts (borowed, begged and stolen).

I hope you find something useful.

Note: If you find something broken, or insecure. Please fix via a pull request and I'll merge ASAP.

Iâ€™m sharing this content because I have a genuine passion for technology and sharing knowledge. I believe by sharing what we learn, we can inspire people to explore, experiment and share themselves.

Or as someone much wiser than me once said:

"Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."
